# Protect the Open Session Owner before automatic availability

Across the owner's three Macs, retain the Open Session Owner through temporary Internet
loss and defer home-side automatic takeover when peer presence is unknown. A working
connection and session ownership are separate concepts: automatic recovery belongs to the existing owner,
while screen-off or lock can trigger handoff. This deliberately favors avoiding session
fights over immediate failover; explicit Manual Reconnect remains the agreed intentional
transfer mechanism when multiple Macs are Open.

The later [Away MacBook priority decision](0002-prioritize-the-away-macbook.md) is an explicit
exception: an Open, Eligible Away MacBook can automatically supersede a home owner. Home
Macs must not use ordinary automatic recovery to reverse that intentional transfer.
The Away MacBook may attempt acquisition despite unknown home-peer presence, while an
accepted explicit Manual Reconnect takes priority over automatic home/away preferences.
